Title: Follow Task Progression using Redis
Version: 0.2.2
Author: Clément TURBELIN
Maintainer: Clément TURBELIN <clement.turbelin@upmc.fr>
Description: Follow tasks progress in a distributed context, using 'Redis', 
    an open source in-memory data structure storage engine <https://redis.io> as a database to exchange data about running tasks. 
    This package provides function to allow a set of tasks, executed in parallel (in the same or on different machines) to send
    information about their progress (like a progress bar). 
    'Redis' is not used as a job queue here (unlike 'doRedis' package), only as a mean to share data about tasks progression.
    A minimal console based interface is also provided to monitor those progress.
