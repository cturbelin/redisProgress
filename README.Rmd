## Overview

The goal of redisProgress is to create a progress bar system to follow tasks distributed across several R instances (on the same host or several). It uses Redis instance to follow tasks progress.

Tasks are grouped in a named "queue" and can be monitored together on the same screen. 

## Installation

```R
# Install the released version from CRAN:
install.packages("redisProgress")

# Install the cutting edge development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cturbelin/redisProgress")
```
## features

- Register progress about a set of tasks (grouped into a named `queue`), each task can have an arbitrary number of steps.
- Task can log a message to the progress queue
- Queue name can be generated ensuring it's unique (a new queue name will be generated each time the main script is run).
- Progress of tasks of a queue can be followed using `redis_progress_monitor()`.

## Usage
See [introduction vignette](vignettes/introduction.Rmd)

## Redis Client implementations

redisProgress can handle several packages implementing redis client API
 
  - `rredis`
  - `RcppRedis`
  - `redux`
  - `rrlite` (Redis without Redis)

`redis_client()` creates a client object embedding the connection context, using a unified interface, regardless the
redis package used. The connection parameters (host, port,...) will be propagated to the R instances.
